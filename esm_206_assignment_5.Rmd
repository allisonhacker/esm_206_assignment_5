## Introduction

The Pacific giant salamander (*Dicamptodon tenebrosus*) is the largest amphibian species in the Pacific Northwest (Figure 1). Although it is not a threatened species, it relies on cold, clean stream habitat for food and reproduction ("Pacific Giant Salamander" n.d.). Logging threatens this habitat by removing canopy cover and increasing soil erosion, which results in warmer water and increased suspended sediment. Due to their sensitivity to such environmental changes, amphibian populations can be used as an indicator of riparian ecosystem health (Welsh and Ollivier, 1998). Pacific giant salamander populations have been monitored in both clear cut and intact old growth forest in Oregon State's H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest since 1993. In this study, we compare salamander abundance and weight in various channel types to explore the effect of logging on salamander populations.

## Data and methods

Pacific giant salamander data were provided by the [Aquatic Vertebrate Population Study](https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-and.4027.12) in Mack Creek, Andrews Experimental Forest (Gregory, 2016). Salamander abundance (individuals) and weight (grams) were determined by annual surveys in a section of cleacut forest (ca. 1963; clear cut) and a 500-year old coniferous forest (old growth). We explored information within three channel classifications: cascades, pools, and side channels. Data collection for Pacific giant salamanders began in 1993 and is ongoing.

Changes in salamander abundance from 1993 to 2017 were explored for each forest section. Abundance was analyzed for 2017 within each channel classification using a chi-square test for independence (alpha = 0.05 throughout). We analyzed differences in mean salamander weight within each forest section using a two-sample, two-sided t-test and within channel classifications with a one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's HSD. R software (version 3.5.1) and RStudio (version 1.2.1335) were used for data analysis and figure generation.

***Figure 2.** Pacific giant salamander abundance (1993-2017). The annual number of observations from an old growth coniferous forest (green) and a clear cut forest (brown) are shown for all years that observations were recorded.*

Trends in salamander abundance between 1993 and 2017 were similar for both sections of Mack Creek. Until 2014, abundance of Pacific giant salamanders was greater in the old growth reach of Mack than in the clear cut reach. From 2015 to 2017, salamander abundance was slightly higher in the clear cut reach than the old growth reach.

#### 1b. Abundance in different channel classifications in 2017

```{r}
# Part B: 2017 salamander counts by channel classification

channel_class <- salamanders %>% 
  filter(year == 2017,
         unittype != "IP") %>% 
  mutate(unittype = case_when(unittype == "C" ~ "Cascade",
                              unittype == "P" ~ "Pool",
                              unittype == "SC" ~ "Side Channel")) %>% 
  group_by(section, unittype) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())
  
 channel_class_wide <- channel_class %>% 
   pivot_wider(names_from = section, values_from = n)

channel_class_props <- channel_class_wide %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "col") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>% 
  adorn_ns(position = "front")

kable(channel_class_props, 
      align = "c",
      col.names = c("Channel Classification",
                    "Clear Cut",
                    "Old Growth")
      ) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover"))
```


```{r}
# Part C: Chi-squared test for effect of forest condition on preferred channel classification
channel_counts <- channel_class_wide %>% 
  select(-unittype)

channel_chi <- chisq.test(channel_counts)
#channel_chi
```

Salamander abundance differed among the three channel classifications. In both clear cut and old growth sections, cascades had the greatest number of salamanders (247 (67.1%)) and 201 (62.8%)), followed by side channels (90 (24.5%)) and 74 (23.1%)). Pools had the fewest number of salamanders for clear cut (31 (8.4%)) and old growth (45 (14.1%)) creek sections.

However, there is no significant effect of forest condition (clear cut and old growth) and the channel classification (cascade, pool, or side channel) where salamanders are found ($\chi^2$ (`r channel_chi$parameter`) = `r round(channel_chi$statistic, 2)`, p = `r round(channel_chi$p.value,3)`).

### 2. Salamander weight 
#### 2a. Weight in clear cut and old growth in 2017

```{r, include = FALSE}

section_weight <- salamanders %>% 
  filter(year == 2017) %>% 
  select(section, weight)

cc_weight <- salamanders %>% 
  filter(year == 2017, section == "CC") %>% 
  select(section, weight)

og_weight <- salamanders %>% 
  filter(year == 2017, section == "OG") %>% 
  select(section, weight)

# data summary

section_weight_summary <- section_weight %>% 
  group_by(section) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            median = median(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            se = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()),
            count = n())

# exploratory data viz

ggplot(section_weight, aes(x = weight,
                                     fill = section)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50)

ggplot(section_weight, aes(sample = weight,
                           color = section)) + 
  geom_qq()

# Data does not seem normally distributed... however, the large sample sizes make it so the means will be normally distributed (Central Limit Theorem), so let's use a parametric test

# t-test
weight_ttest <- t.test(cc_weight$weight, og_weight$weight)
weight_ttest

# effect size
section_weight_es <- cohen.d(cc_weight$weight, og_weight$weight, na.rm = TRUE)
section_weight_es

section_weight_summary

```

Mean salamander weight based in clear cut (7.78 ± 0.52, mean ± standard error, n = 368) and old growth (6.58 ± 0.49, n = 328) forest in 2017 did not differ significantly (two-sample, two-sided t-test, t(`r round(weight_ttest$parameter, 0)`) = `r round(weight_ttest$statistic, 1)`, *p* = `r round(weight_ttest$p.value, 3)`, Cohen's d = `r round(section_weight_es$estimate, 2)`).

#### 2b. Weight in different channel classifications in 2017

We compared salamander weights in 2017 in three different channel classifications: cascades, pools, and side channels (Figure 3). 

```{r, include = FALSE}

# Is data normally distributed? 

channel_weight <- salamanders %>% 
  filter(year == "2017",
         unittype %in% c("C", "P", "SC")) %>% 
  select(unittype, weight, year) %>% 
  na.omit() 

ggplot(channel_weight, aes(sample = weight,
                           color = unittype))+
  geom_qq()

ggplot(channel_weight, aes(x = weight,
                           fill = unittype)) + 
  geom_histogram()

# Data does not seem normally distributed... however, ANOVA is relatively robust to violations of normality, and the large sample sizes make it so the means will be normally distributed (Central Limit Theorem), so let's check for equal variance

# Explore data by channel classification

channel_weight_summary <- channel_weight %>% 
  group_by(unittype) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(weight),
            median = median(weight),
            count = n(),
            sd = sd(weight),
            se = sd(weight) / sqrt(n()),
            var = var(weight))

# Check for equal variances

library(car)

channel_weight_summary 

# The largest variance (185.6) is < 4x greater than the smallest variance (68.31), but they are pretty different so to be sure we will perform a Levene's Test for equal variance: 

levene_channel_weight <- leveneTest(weight ~ unittype, data = channel_weight)

# Not significant (p = 0.09), we retain the null hypothesis of equal variance and will use a one-way ANOVA to compare

channel_aov <- aov(weight ~ unittype, data = channel_weight)

summary(channel_aov)

channel_aov_outputs <- unlist(summary(channel_aov))

channel_aov_outputs

# p = 0.0151, so this is statistically significant. But are they all the same? Or just 2? > post-hoc Tukey's

# Post-hoc Tukey's HSD

tukey_channel_weight <- TukeyHSD(channel_aov)

tukey_df <- data.frame(tukey_channel_weight$unittype)

# Only SC-P is statistically significant, P-C and SC-C are not

The mean weight for salamanders in side channels (`r round(channel_weight_summary$mean[3], 2)` ± `r round(channel_weight_summary$se[3], 2)`g, mean ± standard error, n = `r round(channel_weight_summary$count[3], 2)`) was lower than for those in cascades (`r round(channel_weight_summary$mean[1], 2)` ± `r round(channel_weight_summary$se[1], 2)`g, n = `r round(channel_weight_summary$count[1], 2)`) and pools (`r round(channel_weight_summary$mean[2], 2)` ± `r round(channel_weight_summary$se[2], 2)`, n = `r round(channel_weight_summary$count[2], 2)`). Mean salamander weight differed significantly between the three channel classifications (one-way ANOVA F(`r channel_aov_outputs[1]`, `r channel_aov_outputs[2]`) = `r round(channel_aov_outputs[7], 2)`, *p* = `r round(channel_aov_outputs[9],3)`). Pair-wise comparisons revealed that weights varied significantly between salamanders in side channels and in pools (post-hoc Tukey's HSD, *p* = `r round(tukey_df$p.adj[3], 3)`), but did not differ significantly between those in pools and cascades (*p* = `r round(tukey_df$p.adj[1], 2)`) or between those in side channels and cascades (*p* = `r round(tukey_df$p.adj[2], 3)`). 

However, due to significant outliers, it is possible examining medians, rather than means, would be better for comparing salamander weights in this dataset. Alternative, non-parametric analyses such as Whitney-Mann (for two-sample analysis) and Kruskal-Wallis (for three-sample) should be explored. 

### Summary

- Salamander abundance was similar for clear cut and old growth sections of Mack Creek (Figure 2)
- In both clear cut and old growth sections, cascades had the highest abundance and pools had the lowest abundance of salamanders (Table 1).
- Mean salamander weight in clear cut and old growth sections did not vary significantly. 
- Mean salamander weight was greatest in pools and least in side channels (Figure 3).
